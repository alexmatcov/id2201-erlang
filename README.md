# Erlang Distributed Systems Course Work

This repository represents the coursework from KTH’s ID2201 Distributed Systems Basic course. It presents Erlang implementations that explore core distributed systems concepts.

## Assignment Summaries

- **HW0: Hello Erlang.**  
  Demonstrated process spawning, message passing with selective receive, and multi-node communication.

- **HW1: Routy - a small web server**  
  Built a link-state routing protocol using graph data structures and Dijkstra’s algorithm for shortest paths.

- **HW2: Rudy - a routing network**  
  Developed a minimal HTTP/1.0 server over TCP, handling GET request parsing and static responses.

- **HW3: Loggy - a logical time logger**  
  Implemented Lamport and vector clocks to log events with causality tracking in distributed processes.

- **HW4: Groupy - a group membership service**  
  Created a group membership service with view-change protocols and atomic multicast ordering.

- **HW5: Chordy - a distributed hash table**  
  Implemented a Chord distributed hash table with ring stabilization, finger tables, and key lookups.

- **Tutorial**  
  Covered a quick Erlang tutorial. Some of the topics covered: shell basics, message passing, recursion, built-in function, funs, macros, error handling, distributed programming. More can be found [here](https://www.erlang.org/doc/system/getting_started.html).
